##Pokedex

### description
This project was a pashion project to display all pokemon from the kanto region and to be able to add them to a team to look at later.
This project works with javascript, css, html, and the pokeapi. The pokeapi provided us with all the details about the pokemon and we use it as our database.
I had the most trouble making the left hand side of when you click the name of the pokemon it will display the information.

### instructions
How does it work
-Locate the pokemon name on the left hand side or tpye in its name with the search bar
-once you got the pokemon information that you would like to add to your team click "add to team" button
-at the bottom of the screen you will be able to see all pokemon you have added to your team
-If you want to remove a pokmeon from the team all you need to do is click on its name and it will alert you that the pokemon has been removed


### While you have a pokemon selected you will be able to see its names displayed and be able to click through its sprites.
